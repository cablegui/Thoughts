# What is JIRA?

JIRA from Atlassian is an issue or bug-tracking tracking and project management product. JIRA provides a very organized web interface for a project manager or a risk manager\analyst to create issues to be worked on and tracked. It tightly integrates with Bitbucket version control to deliver an all round SDLC framework for code maintainence and reproducible research projects.

Additional features of JIRA is that it shows you real time progress of a project. As a project manager one can also setup workflows for your team. For example simple workflows can 

* Start with **opening** a task
* Sometimes tasks may be immediately **closed** for whatever reason
* Or the task moves to the next phase **work in progress**
* Task could either then move to **on hold** or **resolved**
* If task in **on hold** area it could move to **closed** or back to **work in progress**
* If a task is **resolved** then next it can move to **closed**
* If task is **closed** it could be **reopened** for whatever reason and the cycle starts again
