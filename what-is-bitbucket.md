# What is BitBucket?

**Bitbucket** is a web-based [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) [repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_%28version_control%29) [hosting service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_web_hosting_service) owned by [Atlassian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlassian), for [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) and development projects that use either [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial) or [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) revision control systems. For us in Deutsche Bank Git is the choice for software used for revision control. 

If you have worked with Github then BitBucket has a similar feel. BitBucket allows an analyst to 

* Create pull requests with subsequent requests by an analyst to review the code and provide comments
* Performing merge checks
* Documentation using markdown format.
* Track open or closed issues
* Creating wikis \(unfortunately this feature is not enabled in Deutsche Bank\)

Bitbucket is free for upto 5 users with unlimited private repositories. It also has a Standard pland and a Premium plan. Deutsche Bank I guess uses the Premium plan as this plan includes merge checking.

How to use Bitbucket will be discussed later on in the book. If you want to jump right in then follow the link [How to tag a release](https://nevilleandrade.gitbook.io/thoughts/~/edit/drafts/-LZsq8tkp4-P-3we_68M/how-to-tag-a-release).
