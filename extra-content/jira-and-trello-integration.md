# JIRA and Trello integration

Setting up Jira thru Bitbucket is quite easy too. Once you have a bitbucket accounton the left corner you get a function to try out the JIRA software

A few more settings are required

To integrate Bitbucket to JIRA select "Add item" in the JIRA webpage

It is quite self explanatory to add either a bitbucket or github repository
