# Preface

In this world of information overload I set out on a journey to kill the demon of chaos. This book is a first in a series of quests to accomplish that goal. My name is Neville Andrade. I work as a risk manager in the credit stress testing department in Deutsche Bank. In my role my team work with a lot of software code written in languages like SAS, R and Python. meant be a ready reference for members of the Credit Stress testing team in Deutsche Bank. It is written with the purpose that a beginner or a senior member in the team can use this book as a ready reference when faced with a question of how to perform a certain task using git. Considering that git is not something that one can pick up in a single day this book is thus also meant to be easy for the reader to digest.

## Who this book is for?

This book is primarily meant to support beginners and seasoned users in the CRM credit stress testing team as a ready reference manual. Typical workflows recognizable to members of the team will be shown thru several sections in the book. Even then, this book has sections written in a cookbook fashion and could help answer questions that a user from any department would have.
