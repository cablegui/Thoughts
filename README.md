# Preface

In this world of information overload I set out on a journey to beat the demon of chaos. This book is a first in a series of quests to accomplish that goal. My name is Neville Andrade. I work as a risk manager in the credit stress testing department in Deutsche Bank. In my role my team work with a lot of software code written in languages like SAS, R and Python. The demon of chaos pokes his head into my kingdom in the form of

* Code being sent thru emails
* Code being saved in obscure locations. 
* Wrong code being used in production because of whatever reasons

Chaos loves this. He knows we are fallible human beings. He knows we forget how diligent we tend to think of ourselves to be. He knows it gets worse as long as he is allowed in the kingdom. This book is thus an attempt to beat him.

## Who this book is for?

This book is primarily meant to support beginners and seasoned users in the CRM credit stress testing team as a ready reference manual. Typical workflows recognizable to members of the team will be shown thru several sections in the book. Even then, this book has sections written in a cookbook fashion and could help answer questions that a user from any department would have.

## What this book is not?

This is not meant to be a bible of all things git. I will try to discuss issues for the many use cases that I have usually faced as part of my and my teams work. For issues which you don't see a solution mentioned give me a shout on the emails below.
