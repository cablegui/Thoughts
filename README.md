# Preface

This book is meant be a ready reference for members of the Credit Stress testing team in Deutsche Bank. It is written with the purpose that a beginner or a senior member in the team can use this book as a ready reference when faced with a question of how to perform a certain task using git. Considering that git is not something that one can pick up in a single day this book is thus also meant to be easy for the reader to digest.
