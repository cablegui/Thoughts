# Configuring Bitbucket access

As part of the team you don't have to do any configuration changes to the bitbucket account. The team have a project called ERM-STARS \(for historic reasons it is still referring to ERM rather than CRM as we were part of ERM team before. Changing it would cost money so we decided to leave it the way it is\). Speak to the project admin \(me!\) if you need access to the bitbucket project.
