# Installing TortoiseGIT \(optional\)

Some of you may prefer a more graphical user interface \(gui\) based approach to work rather than git's dull looking command line interface. If so then a preferable GIT client software TORTOISEGIT is preferable for you. In future chapters I show how to's with both the command line tools and with TORTOISEGIT.

TORTOISEGIT can be requisitioned from the Automated Software Distribution webpage [https://asd.tools.intranet.db.com/ASD2/appsearch?language=1](https://asd.tools.intranet.db.com/ASD2/appsearch?language=1)

TORTOISEGIT will be delivered to your software center. After installing TORTOISEGIT from the Software Center you can check if installed by opening your start menu

You can also right click on any file in your folder and within the drop down you should see tortoisegit as one of the menu options.

TORTOISEGIT offers the ability to make configuration changes as seen in the previous chapter via a settings menu
