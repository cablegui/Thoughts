# What you need to get working with GIT, Bitbucket and JIRA

The instructions here are particular to the organization. As usual they are way behind how teams use software and have very complicated setups compared to open source solutions. The steps here detail the setup and configuration instructions for maintaining the organizations SDLC workflow using Git, Bitbucket and JIRA software. In the "Extra Content" section I have included some chapters on Git, Bitbucket with Continuous Integration tools, JIRA, Github, Travis and Jenkins Windows Integration tools
