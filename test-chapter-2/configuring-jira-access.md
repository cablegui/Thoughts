# Configuring JIRA access

JIRA users will be created automatically during the first login. To achieve this, please login using these credentials \([https://dbatlas.db.com/jira02/](https://dbatlas.db.com/jira02/)\) 

* Username: your DB email
* Password: your WebSSO password

After you login, you should ask JIRA Project administrator to add you to project you need. In our case that would be ERM-STARS.
